            Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, thats what you see at a toy store. And you must think youre in a toy store, because youre here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
